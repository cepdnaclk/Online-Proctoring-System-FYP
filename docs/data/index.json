    "description": "Online examinations require human invigilation either by live monitoring or inspection of recorded video to ensure academic integrity. This process is not feasible always since exams can be taken at any time and it involves high cost.  This project proposes an Online Proctoring System to automate invigilation processes by making use of inputs from a web browser, without using any external hardware or standalone application. As a result, several misconducts during the examination can be identified and labelled as suspicious.",
